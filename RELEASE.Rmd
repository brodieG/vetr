## Release Steps

[x] Coverage 100%
[x] Coverage 100% on codecov

Make sure to check codecov as the algorithms are different (and better?) there.

[x] R CMD check
[ ] winbuilder    r81416
[x] Other locale (e.g. 8859-15, not "latin1")

[x] R 3.3 (vignettes fail, but tests pass)

Github Actions doesn't work anymore with the default Rstudio setup, so we've
just been running locally on our 3.3 version (or on docker?).

[x] Revdep (dataonderivatives; run manually)

[x] Rchk      (via rhub locally)
[x] valgrind  (found an oob access)
[x] SAN
[x] CSAN (catches things GCCSAN does not).

^ Do these last as inevitably we end up making changes

[ ] CRAN policy

[ ] Review documentation
[x] New README
[ ] Logo

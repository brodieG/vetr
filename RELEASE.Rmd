## Release Steps

[x] Coverage 100%
[ ] Coverage 100% on codecov

Make sure to check codecov as the algorithms are different (and better?) there.

[x] R CMD check
[ ] winbuilder    r81416
[ ] Other locale (e.g. 8859-15, not "latin1")

[ ] R 3.2
[ ] R 3.3

Github Actions doesn't work anymore with the default Rstudio setup, so we've
just been running locally on our 3.3 version (or on docker?).

[x] Revdep (dataonderivatives; run manually)

[ ] Rchk
[ ] valgrind
[ ] SAN
[ ] CSAN (catches things GCCSAN does not).

^ Do these last as inevitably we end up making changes

[ ] CRAN policy

[ ] Review documentation
[x] New README
[ ] Logo
